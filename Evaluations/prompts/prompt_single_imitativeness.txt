Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the text generated by an AI writing assistant to the imitative writing task, which is to generate a text on a target topic given an exemplar on a source topic.

Your evaluation should focus on the imitativeness of the generated text of AI writing assistant, i.e, how well does it mimic the exemplar by retaining its structure and cross-topic content consistency, and refraining from adding new content.

Note that for content, you should consider only the talking points without topic-specific details of these talking points.

Be as objective as possible. Provide your explanation, and rate the generated text on a scale of 1 to 5 by strictly following this format: "[[rating]]", for example: "Rating: [[3]]". Please first return the rating and then the explanation in your response.
