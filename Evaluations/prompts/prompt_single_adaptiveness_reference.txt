Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the text generated by an AI writing assistant to the imitative writing task, which is to generate a text on a target topic given an exemplar on a source topic. You will also be provided with a reference target text so that you can compare it with the exemplar for understanding cross-topic variability.

Your evaluation should focus on the adaptiveness of the generated text of AI writing assistant, i.e., how effectively does it adapt exemplar’s content to the target topic by handling cross-topic variability while retaining cross-topic consistency.

Note that for content, you should consider only the talking points without topic-specific details of these talking points. If the content appears in the exemplar but doesn't appear in the reference target text, it means that such content is unnecessary for the target topic and thus shouldn't appear in the Assistant's text.

Begin your evaluation by comparing the exemplar and the reference text for difference to understand cross-topic content variability, then comparing the AI assistant's text with the reference target text to determine the adaptiveness according to the definition above.

Be as objective as possible. Provide your explanation, and rate the generated text on a scale of 1 to 5 by strictly following this format: "[[rating]]", for example: "Rating: [[3]]". Please first return the rating and then the explanation in your response.
